# Unity Google Translation
Simple Google Translation use in Unity for multiple auto-translation. This uses Google Translator, so localization is not possible.

The demo scene is rendered at 1920x1080 resolution in Unity 2019.2.15f1. 
There is no need to add OnClick/OnValueChange event invokes as they are done by code.

Feel free to modify this as you want. If you liked it, credits are appreciated.
